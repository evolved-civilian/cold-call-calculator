As the task requires a web app to be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we will not be creating an .apk file for Android. Instead, we will be creating a simple web application that can be run on any device with a web browser. 

Here are the main files and their purposes:

1. index.html: This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of our web page.
2. style.css: This CSS file will contain the styles for our web page.
3. script.js: This JavaScript file will contain the logic for our cold call calculation.
4. package.json: This file will contain the metadata about the app and its dependencies.

This project was made using SuperAGI.
